# Evening
Alright, take it up, go. Doc. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. 
Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Lorraine, are you up there? Marty, you made it.

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.
That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Yeah. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first 
time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, 
they can't fall in love and I'm history. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you 
instead of your father.

## Electrical
No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity - 
I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Well, it will just happen.
Like the way I met your father. Yeah. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.
